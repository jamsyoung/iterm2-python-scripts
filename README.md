# iTerm2 Python Scripts

These are barely different than the examples at https://iterm2.com/python-api/examples/

- `random-colors.py` - Sets a random theme when a new session opens. Set as an auto-launch script in iTerm
  to get a random theme on every new window or panel.
- `change-theme.py` - Changes the theme of the current session to a different random one.
- `what-color-scheme-is-this.py` - Outputs the name of the current theme.
